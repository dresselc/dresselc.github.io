    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        The program was developed in Unreal 5. We focused on an affordance-based architecture with an emphasis on blueprints and classes to create highly reusable code. 
        We utilized Mixamo, Sketchfab, and Soundcloud to find the project assets (see credits for more details). We utilized Jira Boards to foster an Agile development
         environment and utilized Gitlab as our code-sharing repository. Video output was captured by OBS and the program was run on an Oculus Quest Pro.
